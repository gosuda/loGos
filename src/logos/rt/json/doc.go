// Package json is the runtime support package of the loGo/s static JSON
// feature (M11). The compiler generates MarshalJSON and UnmarshalJSON
// methods for annotated structs and those methods call the helpers in
// this package instead of reflecting over the receiver.
//
// The marshal side (AppendEscaped, AppendQuoted, EscapedLen, QuotedLen,
// IntLen, UintLen, AppendInt, AppendUint, AppendFloat, FloatErr, OmitEmpty,
// OmitZero and MarshalField) produces bytes identical to encoding/json for
// the same value, under both settings of the jsonv2 GOEXPERIMENT. The two
// settings differ in exactly one case, the encoding of an invalid UTF-8
// byte inside a string, which is isolated in escape_v1.go and
// escape_v2.go. Walk carries one root MarshalJSON call's traversal state
// so cycles spanning static helpers and the reflective fallback
// (walk.go, walkfields.go, with mode-specific visit keys in walk_v1.go
// and walk_v2.go) terminate with the reflective cycle error.
//
// The unmarshal side is the Scanner, a cursor over one complete JSON
// value held in memory, plus the typed readers (Bool, Int, Uint, Float,
// String, their quoted forms and Slice). The Scanner validates while it
// decodes, never pre-allocates from untrusted input and reports the same
// error values encoding/json reports: type errors are saved and decoding
// continues, syntax errors are fatal and are taken from encoding/json
// itself so that message and offset are identical.
//
// The package imports only encoding/json, math, reflect, strconv, unicode,
// unicode/utf8 and unsafe.
